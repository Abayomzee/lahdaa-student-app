Developed and maintained by Microsoft, it was first introduced in 2012. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. The primary aim of TypeScript is to make it easier to develop and maintain large-scale applications by introducing types and additional tooling features.",
